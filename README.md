# Node Very Simple Api Express with MongoDB

I'm installing everything by hand but just install the express installer that generates the application skeleton without much work

```
npm install express-generator -g
express api-mongodb-express
```

Used eslint to keep the code clean and verify every single letter of code

```
npm install --save-dev eslint
npx eslint --init
```
